Adding a new client is straightforward with the "Create" button, which directs users to a form for entering client details. Users can also manage existing clients by editing or deleting records using the action links provided. This functionality allows for effective client management and ensures that all client information remains current and accurate.

### Creating and editing records
When creating or editing records, users are guided through intuitive forms where they can enter or modify details. For projects, this includes fields like project name, description, status, and associated client ID. For clients, users will fill out details such as client name, email, and onboarding date.
