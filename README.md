## Description
Telemetry Portal is a robust web application designed to streamline the management of projects and clients. Built with Blazor and ASP.NET Core, it leverages modern web technologies to offer an intuitive interface for CRUD operations on project and client data. The application supports efficient project tracking and client management, providing valuable insights into time and cost savings. With seamless integration for reporting through Power BI, Telemetry Portal enables users to visualize and analyze data effectively.

## How the app is used
Upon accessing Telemetry Portal through your web browser, users are greeted with a clean and user-friendly interface designed for efficient project and client management. The application is divided into intuitive sections that allow users to manage their data with ease.

### Managing Projects
The “Projects” page serves as the central hub for all project-related activities. Here, users can view a comprehensive list of all existing projects, with key details such as project name, description, creation date, status, and associated client ID. To add a new project, users simply click the "Create" button, which navigates to a form where they can input all relevant details. Existing projects can be edited or deleted using the provided action links next to each project entry. This streamlined approach ensures that users can efficiently handle their project data and make necessary updates or removals.

### Managing Clients
Similarly, the “Clients” page provides a detailed overview of all client records. Users can see essential client information including name, primary contact email, and onboarding date. Adding a new client is straightforward with the "Create" button, which directs users to a form for entering client details. Users can also manage existing clients by editing or deleting records using the action links provided. This functionality allows for effective client management and ensures that all client information remains current and accurate.

### Creating and editing records
When creating or editing records, users are guided through intuitive forms where they can enter or modify details. For projects, this includes fields like project name, description, status, and associated client ID. For clients, users will fill out details such as client name, email, and onboarding date. Validation and error handling ensure that all required fields are correctly filled out before submission.

### Viewing and Analyzing Data
Telemetry Portal also integrates with Power BI for advanced reporting and data analysis. Users can generate and view reports that provide insights into project and client data, including time and cost savings. This feature helps users make informed decisions based on comprehensive data visualizations, enhancing the overall utility of the application.
